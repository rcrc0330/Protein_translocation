1. Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Based on Data Partition and Semi-Random Subspace Method (June 29 2018)
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28084-8
Aim: to outperform state of art method in predicting secondary structures of protiens ~85-86% accuracy (Proposed PSRSM method)
Methodology: data patitioning based on protien subsequence length, then SRSM(semi-random subspace method) to create
	     subspaces, then training base classifiers(SVM) on the subspaces, then combining them by majority rule vote on each subset.

2. Single-molecule protein sensing in a nanopore: a tutorial
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309966/
Summary: It's a elaborated tutorial on determining primary animo acid sequencing of the protien through change ionic current in the pore during
         translocation of the protien through the nanopore.
