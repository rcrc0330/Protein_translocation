In this folder ("Examples"), some case studies of GROTOLAM usage are reported.

The following sub-folders are included:
  - "CNT", which contains a case study where GROTOLAM is used to convert a molecular
    dynamics configuration made of a carbon nanotube solvated in a water box;
  - "IONP", which contains a case study where GROTOLAM is used to convert a molecular
    dynamics configuration made of a iron oxide nanoparticle solvated in a water box.
