input: length and depth of surface, diameter and width of the hole, diameter of small and large spheres
output: 1,x,y,z for -l/2,l/2, and cylinder walls

week 2

big box along the  width of the whole, make in lamps, another particle with negative charge outside and inside the pore, neutral and fixed atoms of previous

columb interations, the force between stationary n moving particle only ina radius of contact, externally imposed electrical field on charged particle.
lanjevion and nve only on, moving part
lj cut 1.12 then pair coeff 1
lj cutt force 0 and min gives 1.12

5 moving particles

100 mv 10 nm electric field
2%-10% for outside the pore

nucleotide of a dna/ amino acid of a protien
Mass - 130 g/mol (if amino acids it can vary)
length scale is 3 angstroms
epsilon = KB*T (T=298.15K)

peptide translocating through nanopore, protien unfolding,(out thing how many folds in a protien, knowing it's primary sequence) 

Next week - polymer chains instead of single atoms

check calculation, increase polymer size to 30nm, decide topic and read paper-secondary structure using protien translocation
https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1302280/1/1302280.pdf

search - average binding energy between residues that participate in aplha helix vs beta sheet (coarse grain modelling of protiens)
